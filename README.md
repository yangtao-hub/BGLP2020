# Prerequisites
The code is designed to be run on the OhioT1DM Dataset.

# Preparation before operation
1. You need to use Excel to convert XML files from OhioT1DM Dataset into XLSX files.
2. You need to manually complete the "basal" list in the XLSX file. This is simple for people, they only need to complete it according to the information from the previous day.
3. After completing the above two steps, include the path of the XLSX file in the experiments directory of the project in the two YAML files.

# Install dependency libraries
You can install the required dependencies in bulk through requirements.txt.
